# odin-recipes
My first project with The Odin Project. A basic recipe website.

In this project I will be demonstrating basic HTML skills that I have learnt so far by creating a very basic website that will link to a few recipes.

Skills I have demonstrated:

Using Git and Github as a version control system on my project.

Continuously creating commits through git on the command line and pushing the commits to the repository on Github.

Using html to create a multiple page website with links to each page.

Creating various lists with html and attaching images to the page.
