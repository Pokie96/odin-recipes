            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Butter and line a loose-bottomed tin with baking parchment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Put crushed digestive biscuits in to a bowl with melted butter 
                    and mix until crumbs are completely coated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transfer mix to the prepared tin and press down in to the base to 
                    create an even layer. Leave this in fridge for 1 hour to set.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Slice the vanilla pod lengthways, leaving the tip intact so the 
                    two halves are still joined. Scrape out the seeds of the pod 
                    using the back of a kitchen knife. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour the double cream into a bowl and whisk with a mixer until 
                    it's just starting to thicken.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the soft cheese, icing sugar and vanilla seeds in seperate 
                    bowl, and beat with electric mixer until it starts to thicken.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the double cream to the mixture and fold until mixed thoroughly 
                    and thick consistency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spoon mixture on to the biscuit base, then smooth the top of the 
                    cheesecake.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Leave the mix to set in fridge overnight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bring cheesecake to room temp before serving.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Purée half of the strawberries in a blender with the icing sugar 
                    and add the purée over the top.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the remaining strawberries on top of the cake to serve
